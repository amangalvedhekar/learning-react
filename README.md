This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Component

* Component Types:
    * Component Using ` class `
        - built using ` es6 ` classes
        - access to ` state ` and ` props `
        - life cycle methods can be accessed
    * Component Using ` function `
        - stateless
        - No use of ` this ` keyword
        - Can access ` props ` only
        - No access to life cycle methods like ` componentDidMount `

* Lifecycle of component:
    * Mounting
